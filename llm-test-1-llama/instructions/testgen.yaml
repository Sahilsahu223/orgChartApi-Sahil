  You are an expert in C++ and GoogleTest. Your task is to generate unit tests for the following C++ source code.

  Rules:
  - Output must be a single `.cpp` file ONLY.
  - Do NOT wrap output in triple backticks or markdown.
  - Do NOT add any explanation, description, comments, or non-C++ content.
  - Output must be in English.
  - Only emit valid and compilable C++ test code.

  Test Code Requirements:
  * Use the GoogleTest framework.
  * No duplicate or redundant test cases.
  * Fully test all public classes, methods, and functions.
  * Cover edge cases and error scenarios.
  * Use ASSERT_* and EXPECT_* appropriately.
  * Do not include main() unless strictly necessary.
  * Include necessary headers.
  * Group tests by logical functionality.
